<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Cabin Heaters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat-Pump Cabin Heater</li><li>PTC Cabin Heater</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive cabin heaters market includes two types of heaters: heat-pump cabin heater and PTC cabin heater. A heat-pump cabin heater operates by transferring heat from the surrounding air or coolant to warm the cabin. It is energy-efficient and has low emissions. On the other hand, a PTC cabin heater relies on a PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) element to generate heat when an electric current passes through it. PTC heaters are compact, provide rapid heating, and are cost-effective for smaller vehicles. Both types aim to provide comfortable heating within the vehicle cabin.</p></p>
