<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stone Water Repellent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solvent Based</li><li>Water Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Stone Water Repellent market can be categorized into two types: Solvent-based and Water-based. Solvent-based repellents are formulated with chemicals that dissolve in solvents, like mineral spirits or toluene. These solutions create a protective layer on the stone surface, preventing water penetration and providing durability. On the other hand, water-based repellents contain chemicals that can be diluted with water. They form a thin, breathable film on the stone, allowing water vapor to escape while still protecting against water damage. Both types offer effective water repellency, but differ in their application and environmental impact.</p></p>
