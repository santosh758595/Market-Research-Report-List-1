<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radiant Barrier & Reflective Insulation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radiant Barrier</li><li>Reflective Insulation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radiant barriers and reflective insulation are types of materials used in construction to reduce heat transfer. Radiant barriers are composed of a highly reflective material, such as aluminum foil, which reflects radiant heat away from a surface. Reflective insulation, on the other hand, consists of a layer of insulation material, often coupled with a reflective surface, that reflects heat and reduces heat conduction. Both types of products are designed to improve energy efficiency by reducing the amount of heat that penetrates the building, thus maintaining a more comfortable indoor temperature.</p></p>
