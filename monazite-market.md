<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Monazite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acid Cracking</li><li>Alkaline Cracking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Monazite, a rare earth mineral, has two different market types: acid cracking and alkaline cracking. Acid cracking involves the treatment of monazite with sulfuric acid to extract rare earth elements (REEs) while leaving thorium behind. This method is utilized in countries with strict regulations concerning thorium contamination. On the other hand, alkaline cracking uses sodium hydroxide to dissolve monazite, resulting in the extraction of both REEs and thorium. This process is employed in countries where thorium has commercial value, such as for nuclear fuel.</p></p>
