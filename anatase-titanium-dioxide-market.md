<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anatase Titanium Dioxide Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sulfate Process</li><li>Chloride Process</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The anatase titanium dioxide market can be categorized into two major types: the sulfate process market and the chloride process market. In the sulfate process, titanium dioxide is produced by reacting titanium ore (usually ilmenite) with sulfuric acid. This process is widely used as it produces high-quality titanium dioxide, but it is more expensive and time-consuming. On the other hand, the chloride process involves the reaction of titanium tetrachloride with oxygen, resulting in a lower-cost and more efficient production of titanium dioxide. Both processes have their own advantages and market demand depends on various factors.</p></p>
