<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Angiographic Entry Needles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>With Wing</li><li>Without Wing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Angiographic entry needles are used for puncturing blood vessels during angiography procedures. They come in two main types: with wing and without wing. The with-wing needles have small plastic wings on the side, which provide a firm grip for secure and stable handling. These wings help in precise control and prevent accidental slippage. On the other hand, the without-wing needles are simpler in design, lacking wings, but still effective for entry into blood vessels. Both types serve the same purpose, allowing healthcare professionals to access blood vessels for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.</p></p>
