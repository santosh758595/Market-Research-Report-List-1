<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Building Geomembrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Rough</li><li>Double Rough</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The building geomembrane market is categorized into two types - single rough and double rough. Single rough geomembranes have one textured side that provides friction and stability against slipping. These are commonly used in applications where slope stability or resistance to sliding is important. On the other hand, double rough geomembranes have textured surfaces on both sides, enhancing their frictional characteristics and allowing for increased stability. This type is often employed in scenarios where a high level of slip resistance is required, such as landfill liners or containment applications.</p></p>
