<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Operated Aluminum Diaphragm Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting</li><li>Double Acting</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The air-operated aluminum diaphragm pump market is divided into two types: single acting and double acting. Single acting pumps operate using air pressure on one side of the diaphragm, causing it to move and create suction. The liquid is then drawn into the pump on one stroke. In contrast, double acting pumps use air pressure on both sides of the diaphragm, allowing for liquid to be drawn in on one stroke while simultaneously being discharged on the other stroke.</p></p>
