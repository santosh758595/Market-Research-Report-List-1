<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sintering Diamond Saw Blades Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dry Operation</li><li>Wet Operation</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Sintering diamond saw blades are categorized into two types: dry operation and wet operation. Dry operation blades are designed for use without water or any other coolant. They are capable of cutting various materials but tend to generate more heat, leading to lower blade life. On the other hand, wet operation blades require the presence of water or coolant during cutting. They are more efficient, generate less heat, and have longer blade life due to the lubrication provided by the water.</p></p>
