<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Resuscitators and transport ventilators are medical devices used to assist patients with breathing difficulties. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is a type of ventilation that delivers a continuous flow of air pressure to keep the airways open during sleep or in patients with respiratory conditions. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) is a form of ventilation delivered through a mask or nasal prongs without invasive procedures. "Others" in the market refers to any other types or variations of resuscitators and transport ventilators available in the market.</p></p>
