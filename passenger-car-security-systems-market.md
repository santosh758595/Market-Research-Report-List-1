<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Car Security Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Immobilizer</li><li>Remote Keyless Entry (RKE)</li><li>Passive Keyless Entry (PKE)</li><li>Passive Keyless Go (PKG)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Passenger car security systems have evolved to provide advanced protection against theft and unauthorized access. These systems can be categorized into four types: immobilizer, remote keyless entry (RKE), passive keyless entry (PKE), and passive keyless go (PKG). An immobilizer prevents the engine from being started without the correct key, while RKE allows drivers to lock/unlock the car remotely. PKE systems use proximity sensors to automatically unlock the car when the key fob is within range, while PKG systems also enable starting the engine with the push of a button.</p></p>
