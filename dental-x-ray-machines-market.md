<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental X-Ray Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ordinary X-rays</li><li>Panoramic X-rays</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Dental X-ray machines are used in dental clinics to obtain images of the teeth and gums. There are two main types of dental X-ray machines: ordinary X-rays and panoramic X-rays. Ordinary X-rays, also known as intraoral X-rays, capture detailed images of individual teeth and their roots. Panoramic X-rays, on the other hand, provide a broader view of the entire mouth, showing all the teeth, jawbones, and related structures in a single image. Both types of X-rays are essential tools for diagnosing dental conditions and planning treatments effectively.</p></p>
