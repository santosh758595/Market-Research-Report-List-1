<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Handheld DNA Sequencer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nanopore sequencing</li><li>Single-Molecule Real-Time Sequencing</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The handheld DNA sequencer market includes two prominent types: nanopore sequencing and single-molecule real-time sequencing. Nanopore sequencing involves the use of nanopores, extremely thin channel-like structures, to pass DNA strands through. As the DNA moves through the nanopore, it generates electrical signals, allowing for real-time sequencing of the DNA. Single-molecule real-time sequencing, on the other hand, utilizes fluorescently-labeled nucleotides that emit light signals when incorporated into the DNA chain during sequencing. This method enables real-time observation and analysis of the sequencing process. Both types offer portable solutions for DNA sequencing in various applications.</p></p>
