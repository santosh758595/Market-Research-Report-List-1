<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Auto-Dimming Mirrors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rearview Mirror</li><li>Side View Mirror</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The auto-dimming mirrors market comprises two main types: rearview mirrors and side view mirrors. Rearview mirrors are placed inside the vehicle, allowing drivers to view what's behind them without turning around. They automatically dim to reduce glaring headlights from vehicles behind, enhancing visibility. Side view mirrors, on the other hand, are located on the exterior of the vehicle and provide additional visibility to the sides. They also feature auto-dimming technology, minimizing glare from vehicles in adjacent lanes and improving safety during nighttime or low-light conditions.</p></p>
