<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Healing Polymer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vascular</li><li>Intrinsic</li><li>Capsule Based</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The self-healing polymer market is categorized into three types: vascular, intrinsic, and capsule-based systems. </p><p>Vascular self-healing polymers are designed with a network of microvascular channels that can disperse healing agents when a crack or damage occurs. These channels help in the redistribution and repair of the damaged areas.</p><p>Intrinsic self-healing polymers have the capability to autonomously heal themselves without the need for external stimuli. These polymers contain specific bonds that can reform when broken, leading to the restoration of the material's integrity.</p><p>Capsule-based self-healing polymers consist of tiny capsules filled with healing agents. When damage occurs, these capsules rupture and release the healing agents to repair the material. This system is usually triggered by a physical or chemical stimulus.</p></p>
