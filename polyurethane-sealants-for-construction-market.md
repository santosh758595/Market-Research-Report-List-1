<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyurethane Sealants for Construction Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Component</li><li>Multi Component</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Polyurethane sealants for construction are available in two market types: single component and multi-component. </p><p>Single component sealants are pre-mixed and ready to use. They are typically sold in cartridges and can be applied directly onto surfaces without the need for additional mixing or preparation. These sealants cure when exposed to the air and form a durable, flexible seal.</p><p>On the other hand, multi-component sealants consist of two or more components that need to be mixed before application. These components, such as a base and catalyst, are often packaged separately. Once mixed, the sealant starts to cure and forms a strong bond, offering excellent adhesion and resilience.</p><p>Both single component and multi-component polyurethane sealants have their advantages and are widely used in various construction applications.</p></p>
