<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Highway Impact Attenuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-redirective Impact Attenuators</li><li>Redirective Impact Attenuators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Highway Impact Attenuators are safety devices used to reduce the severity of vehicle collisions on highways. Non-redirective Impact Attenuators are designed to absorb the impact energy and prevent the vehicle from rebounding, thereby reducing the risk of secondary collisions. Redirective Impact Attenuators, on the other hand, are designed to redirect the vehicle away from hazardous areas and provide a gradual deceleration in the event of a collision. Both types of attenuators play a crucial role in improving highway safety by minimizing the potential damage and injuries caused by accidents.</p></p>
