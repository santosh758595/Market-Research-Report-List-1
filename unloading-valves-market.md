<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Unloading Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Type I unloading valves are used in applications where there is a relatively constant pressure, and the valve remains open until the pressure exceeds a set limit. At that point, the valve will close, preventing any further flow and maintaining system integrity. On the other hand, Type II unloading valves are designed to open when pressure limits are exceeded and close when the pressure drops below a specified level. They are commonly used in systems where intermittent pressure fluctuations occur, allowing for controlled relief and prevention of system damage.</p></p>
