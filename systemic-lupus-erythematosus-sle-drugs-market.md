<p><strong>Major Market Players</strong></p>
<p><p>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects multiple organs and causes inflammation. There are several companies in the market that offer drugs for the treatment of SLE, with players such as Anthera Pharmaceuticals, GSK, ImmuPharma, and Johnson & Johnson being prominent names.</p><p>Anthera Pharmaceuticals is a biopharmaceutical company that focuses on developing and commercializing therapeutics for autoimmune diseases. In the past, the company has conducted clinical trials for its SLE drug candidate, blisibimod. However, in 2017, Anthera Pharmaceuticals faced a setback when the Phase III trial of blisibimod failed to meet its primary endpoint of significantly reducing disease activity in SLE patients. Despite this setback, the company continues to explore potential treatment options for SLE and other autoimmune diseases.</p><p>GSK, also known as GlaxoSmithKline, is a global pharmaceutical company with a diverse portfolio of drugs in various therapeutic areas. While GSK does not have a specific drug approved for SLE, the company offers treatments for related autoimmune diseases. For example, GSK's drug Benlysta (belimumab) is the only FDA-approved treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus. Benlysta is a biologic drug that targets a specific component of the immune system involved in SLE.</p><p>ImmuPharma is a specialist drug discovery and development company focused on developing drugs for autoimmune diseases. The company's lead product candidate is called Lupuzor, which is a potential treatment for SLE. Lupuzor has completed Phase III clinical trials and has shown promising results in reducing disease activity and improving patient outcomes. ImmuPharma is actively pursuing regulatory approvals for Lupuzor and aims to bring it to market as a viable SLE treatment option.</p><p>Johnson & Johnson is a multinational pharmaceutical and consumer goods company, with a pharmaceutical division known as Janssen Pharmaceuticals. While Janssen does not have a significant presence in the SLE market, the company develops drugs for other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. These include drugs like Stelara, Simponi, and Remicade, which are approved for conditions such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease.</p><p>As for sales revenue, it's important to note that detailed financial information may not be readily available for these specific companies in relation to their SLE drugs, as the market size for SLE medications is influenced by multiple factors and may not be separately reported. Nonetheless, the market size for SLE drugs is estimated to be in the billions of dollars globally, and these companies, along with other players in the market, aim to capture their share of this market by providing effective and innovative treatment options for SLE patients.</p></p>
