<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hands Free Power Liftgate Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fully Automatic</li><li>Semi-automatic</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The hands-free power liftgate market comprises two types: fully automatic and semi-automatic systems. Fully automatic liftgates require no physical effort and open and close by themselves when activated, using advanced sensor technology. On the other hand, semi-automatic liftgates require some manual intervention, such as pressing a button or kicking a sensor, to initiate the opening or closing process. Both types offer convenience and ease of use, but the fully automatic ones provide a completely hands-free experience, while the semi-automatic ones require a small level of interaction from the user.</p></p>
