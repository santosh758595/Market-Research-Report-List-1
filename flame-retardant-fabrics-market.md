<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant Fabrics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogenated Organic Flame Retardants</li><li>Organophosphorus Flame Retardants</li><li>Inorganic Flame Retardants</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flame retardant fabrics market can be categorized into three types: halogenated organic flame retardants, organophosphorus flame retardants, and inorganic flame retardants. Halogenated organic flame retardants contain halogen elements (such as chlorine or bromine) that release gases when exposed to fire, thereby suppressing the combustion process. Organophosphorus flame retardants inhibit flame spread by forming a protective layer on the fabric's surface. Inorganic flame retardants consist of materials like aluminum hydroxide or magnesium hydroxide, which release water vapor when heated, reducing the fabric's flammability. These three types offer varying levels of flame resistance for fabric applications.</p></p>
